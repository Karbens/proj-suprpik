		</ol>
	</li>

	<li><b>HOW TO PLAY</b>. On your "Make A Pick" page you're asked to select the outcome of a listed matchup between teams, individual competitors or a combination of both. Listed times are based on the expected start time of an event, but may be changed by the CONTEST Administrator to accommodate start times that have been changed, or for any other reason, in Sportsbetting.com's sole discretion. If a matchup is mistakenly left open after an event has begun, the Game Administrator may close the event late or cancel the event altogether, at Sportsbetting.com's sole discretion. YOU CAN ONLY SELECT ONE MATCHUP PER DAY. Once the matchup you have selected has been marked FINAL you will be able to select the winner of a matchup which hasn't started yet. The CONTEST Administrator may add matchups at any time; however, the majority of matchups will be available on the contest page at 9:00 AM ET on the day of the event.<br /><br />

	Here are examples of matchups between two teams:
	
	<ul>
		<li>NCAA FOOTBALL - Oregon Ducks at UCLA Bruins</li>
		<li>NFL - Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs</li>
		<li>Soccer - Arsenal at AC Milan</li>
		<li>NHL - Buffalo Sabres at Philadelphia Flyers</li>
	</ul>

	Here are examples of "prop" matchups between teams, players or a combination of both:
	<ul>
		<li>NFL - Tom Brady Pass Completions vs. New York Jets 1st Downs 
		<li>MLB - Colorado Rockies Hits vs. Jake Peavy Strikeouts 
		<li>GOLF - Brandt Snedeker Lower 1st Round vs. Ernie Els Lower 1st Round 
		<li>NBA/MLB - Philadelphia 76ers points scored vs. Cole Hamels pitch count
	</ul>

	For most prop matchups the side with the HIGHER score, time or total will be declared the winner, but in some, the side that is LOWER will win. Please read the prop matchup questions and corresponding opponents carefully before making your pick.<br /><br />

	All participants start at zero. If you win a matchup your streak continues; if you lose it, you're back to 0. Your streak is measured by the number of consecutive outcomes you correctly selected from the officially listed matchups.<br /><br />

	You are not required to play every day, but you must make at least one selection every five days. Matchups that end as a tie will be scored as a "PUSH" and your streak will remain intact. Matchups may also be cancelled by the Game Administrator for reasons including (but not limited to) player injuries, player absences, or inability to complete the match because of weather or any other reason; if this occurs, the matchup will be emailed to customers listed as "No Action", Cancelled", "Postponed" or "OFF" and scored as "PUSH". In all such cases, the Game Administrator's decision is final, binding and non-appealable. In the event that the matchup you selected is marked as a "PUSH", your streak will NOT end, but rather your record remains at the same number prior to the "Push"<br /><br />

	Please note, you must make at least one selection every five days.</li>

	<li><b>PRIZES</b>. Prizes for streaks and applicable restrictions as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Grand Prize (awarded to each registered entrant to make 30 consecutive correct selections, subject to verification, during the CONTEST period) - is $1,000,000 cash (US Currency).

[Terms to be discussed re: annuity]</li>
			
			<li>All registered entrants who make 25 consecutive correct selections during the CONTEST Period will receive $25,000.00 cash, however this is subject to the conclusion of the player's streak. If the entrant extends their streak to 30 in a row, the entrant will receive $1,000,000 for reaching the 30 streaker level. Any streak finishing in the 26-29 range will result in $25,000.00 for the eligible entrant.</li>
			
			<li>All registered entrants who make 20 consecutive correct selections during the CONTEST Period will receive $10,000.00 cash, regardless of when entrants' streak ends.</li>
